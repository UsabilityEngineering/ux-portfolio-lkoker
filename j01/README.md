# The Failure of Payday 3 UI

Earlier this month, the long-awaited sequel of the Payday franchise, Payday 3, came out. The game's launch was utterly abysmal, suffering from a terrible early-access stage that was not even available to PlayStation 5 users who paid for it and servers that shut down for 3 consecutive days. When the game was finally playable, players were greeted by a horrid and confusing UI. Now for the more simple actions the UI does suffice but I want to focus on 3 main issues that are experience-defining. 
  - In-game Lobby/Matchmaking
  - The Weapon Stat System
  - The Mission Selection

## In-game Lobby/Matchmaking

The game only offers online matchmaking for players who are in the game. This means that the whole game is server-dependent, so if the servers go down the game goes down. The user base has been asking for an offline solo mode for years as it was previously available in Payday 2. The developers' failure to provide this fundamental feature has resulted in the majority of their problems retaining players and their failing servers. Even if you are lucky enough to get in the lobby, many features and problems arise once you are in there. Server instability causes the lobby to lag and the loadout function barely works. Although it shows that you can change loadouts by hitting the arrows on the loadout tab, 50% of the time your loadout does not even switch when you get into the mission. Another point of aggravation is there is no ability to talk to your teammates and coordinate a plan to complete missions. In the previous installments, the ability to communicate with your team has been fundamental and available since the very first version of Payday The Heist (Payday 1). To top it all off, the cluttered and laggy UI has no ability to un-ready once you hit the ready button. If you accidentally ready or decide you want to make a last-minute change, the game forces you to quit back to the main menu, it won't even send you back to the mission select screen. All these steps to get into the game and missing features have turned players away from engaging with this product, and it gets worse.
